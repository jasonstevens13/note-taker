## Description
  This full-stack application allows the user to create a to-do list on the web. The app takes in tasks via the front-end user interface and writes them to the back-end database (in this case a json file rather than a sql server). The application utilizes node.js and express.js to implement the server.
  
## Installation
  The app is web-based and can be accessed via the browswer! It's simple to use - simply visit the url and view your list, add/delete notes. The to-do list persists in the "database" so you may close the page and revisit later to find the same list you left off at. Awesome!
  
## Usage
  The app demonstrates a real-world solution for a digital to-do list. The project can be expanded on in so many ways!

## Tests 
  Tests have note yet been written; however, the intent is to add tests that the developer may run. This will of course validate that the application will continue to perform as expected. The tests will be ran via an 'npm run test' command.
